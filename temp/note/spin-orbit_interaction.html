        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        In quantum physics, the spin-orbit interaction (also called spin-orbit
        effect or spin-orbit coupling) is a relativistic interaction of a particle's
        spin with its motion inside a potential. <br><br>

        A key example of this phenomenon is the spin-orbit interaction leading to
        shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels, due to electromagnetic
        interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion,
        and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This
        phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be
        thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the
        apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic
        moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin. A similar effect,
        due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear
        force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading
        to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field
        of spintronics, spin-orbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other
        materials are explored for technological applications. The spin-orbit
        interaction is one cause of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall
        effect.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Relativistic origin of the Spin-Orbit Interaction</h3>

        According to the theory of relativity, a particle moving in an electrical
        field experiences an effective magnetic field, which is directed perpendicularly
        to the electrical field and the particle movement direction. The interaction of
        this effective magnetic field with the electron spin is called Spin-Orbit
        interaction. It is important to emphasize that the direction and magnitude
        of the effective magnetic field do not depend either on the particle charge
        or on the particle spin. <br><br>

        According to this theory, the electric and magnetic field mutually
        transformed into each other depending on the speed of an observer. For
        example, if in a coordinate system of static observer there is only a
        magnetic field, a movable observer will experience this field as both
        an electrical field and a magnetic field. <br><br>

        A particle moving in a static magnetic field experience an effective
        electric field. The effective electrical field acts on the particle
        charge (the Lorentz force, Hall effect) and forces the particle to move
        along this field. <br><br>

        A particle moving in a static electrical field experience an effective
        magnetic field. The effective magnetic field acts on the particle magnetic
        moment (spin-orbit interaction) and causes the precession of the magnetic
        moment around the direction of the effective magnetic field. <br><br>

        The electromagnetic field is a relativistic object and the Lorentz
        transformation equations are written as,

        $$\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{move} = \frac{\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \text{ ;} \\ \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{move} = \frac{\mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static} - \frac{\mathbf{v}}{c^2} \times \mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

        where, $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{static}, \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{static}$ are the
        electric and magnetic field in the static coordinate system and
        $\mathbf{E}_\mathrm{move}, \mathbf{H}_\mathrm{move}$ are the elctric and
        magnetic field in the coordinate system, which moves with a constant
        velocity $\mathbf{v}$.

        As a result, an electron, which moves in a static magnetic field
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{static}$, experiences in own reference frame an
        effective electrical field $\mathbf{E}_\text{Hall}$, which is called
        the Hall field (Hall voltage). Similarly, when an electron moves in a
        static electrical field $\mathbf{E}_\text{static}$, it experiences in
        own reference frame an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$,
        which is called the effective spin-orbit magnetic field. <br><br>

        For example, when an electron moves in the $x$-direction,
        $$v_x \neq 0 \qquad \text{;} \qquad v_y = 0 \qquad \text{;} \qquad v_z = 0$$

        the effective electric field and the effective magnetic field are,
        $$E_\text{Hall} = E_\text{y} = - \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} H_\text{z} \text{ ;} \\ H_\text{SO} = H_\text{y} = \frac{\frac{v}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} E_\text{z}$$

        For the non-relativistic case $(v << c)$:
        $$\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \simeq 1$$

        The effective electric field and the effective magnetic field are then,
        $$E_\text{Hall} = E_\text{y} = - v H_\text{z} \text{ ;} \\ H_\text{SO} = H_\text{y} = \frac{v}{c^2} E_\text{z}$$

        <strong>Question:</strong> An electron always moves along the electrical
        field (but not perpendicularly). Then, how it can experience the spin-orbit
        interaction? <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The trajectory of an electron may be very different.
        There are many cases when an electron moves perpendicularly to an electrical
        field. For example, when the electron is orbiting around a nucleus. <br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Which parameter characterizes the spin-orbit
        interaction? Is it a classical parameter or a quantum mechanical parameter?
        <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> There is only one cause of spin-orbit interaction.
        It is the magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. All other parameters are
        consequences of $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. For example, the electron spin
        aligns itself along $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. It changes the energy of the
        electron. The change in energy can be defined as the energy of the
        spin-orbit interaction $E_\text{SO}$. If an additional external magnetic
        field $\mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ is applied, the electron spin is aligned along
        the total magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO} + \mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ and
        $E_\text{SO}$ has no physical meaning. <br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Since the spin-orbit magnetic field
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ is proportional to $1/c^2$, then it should
        be negligibly small. Should we care about such a tiny effect? <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. It is small, except for when
        $\mathbf{E}_\text{static}$ is huge. For example, near the nucleus
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ is large. Any substantial spin-orbit interaction
        is induced only by an electrical field of a nucleus. Other realistic
        sources of the electrical field in a solid induce very weak spin-orbit
        interaction. This field is very symmetric, and it cancels itself out in
        a nucleus. External fields may break this symmetry. <br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Is spin-orbit interaction is a quantum
        mechanical effect?<br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> No. The spin-orbit interaction affects both small
        and large objects. It exists in the macro world as well.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Energy of Spin-Orbit interaction</h3>

        <img class="center" src="https://staff.aist.go.jp/v.zayets/SpinTransport/32/soPrecessionS.gif" alt="">

        There is a precession of electron spin $\mathbf{S}$ around magnetic
        field $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ of spin-orbit interaction until it is
        aligned parallel to $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. After the electron spin
        is aligned, the energy of spin-orbit interaction becomes,

        $$E_\text{SO} = \mu_\text{B} H_\text{SO}$$

        where, $\mu_\text{B}$ is the Bohr magneton. <br><br>

        The $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ only interacts with the spin magnetic
        moment, not with the orbital magnetic moment. <br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Why $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ does not induce
        the Lorentz force and cannot interact with the orbital magnetic moment?
        <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ has relativistic origin.
        It appears only in the coordinate system which moves together with the
        electron. The Lorentz force has the relativistic origin as well and it
        is originated from the electrical field, which the electron experiences
        when moves in a magnetic field. In the moving coordinate system, where
        the electron experiences $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$, the electron does not
        move and therefore experience no Lorentz force. The interaction of the
        orbital moment with a magnetic field is due to the Lorentz force. <br><br>

        Electron spin is aligned along due to the spin precession damping.
        The spin precession damping is a complex mechanism, which involves
        an external particle with a non-zero spin (e.g. a photon, a magnon).
        It could take a relatively long time until the full alignment of
        electron spin along $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. <br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Is there any cases when the electron spin
        is not aligned along $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$? <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> There are many such cases. For example, the
        conduction electrons in a metal. There are many conduction electrons,
        which simultaneously overlap with each other. For this reason, the
        scattering between quantum states of conduction electrons is very
        frequent. The time between two consequent scattering is very short
        $(\sim 1 \mathrm{\: ps})$. This time is not enough for the
        complete alignment.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Magnitude of the Spin-Orbit interaction</h3>

        Except for a few weak effects, all spin-orbital effects are induced
        by an electrical field of an atomic nucleus and the electron movement
        (rotation) in the close proximity of the nucleus. <br><br>

        For a realistic spin-orbit interaction, the maximum value of drift
        velocity of electron in a solid is $1 \times 10^7 \mathrm{\: cm/s}$
        (GaAs, Si) <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_velocity">[Ref]</a>.
        The electron cannot go faster, because above the saturation velocity
        the electron intensively illuminates phonons. The maximum breakdown
        voltage applicable to a semiconductor is $5 \times 10^5 \mathrm{\: cm/s}$
        (a oxide). For higher voltage, the avalanche breakdown occurs. <br><br>

        For these values, the effective magnetic field of the spin-orbit
        interaction is only $0.5 \mathrm{\: Gauss}$. For comparison, Earth's
        magnetic field is about $0.25-0.65 \mathrm{\: Gauss}$. <br><br>

        For an electron rotating around the nucleus, the speed of the electron
        is about $\sim 2.1 \times 10^6 \mathrm{\: m/s}$. The Coulomb electrical
        field in H atom at the first orbital $(r = 0.053 \mathrm{\: nm})$ is
        $5.1 \times 10^9 \mathrm{\: V/cm}$. <br><br>

        For these values, the effective magnetic field of the spin-orbit
        interaction is $125 \mathrm{\: kGauss} = 12.5 \mathrm{\: T}$.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Spin-Orbit interaction and orbital moment</h3>

        Electron orbital can be represented as 2D electron rotation around a rotating axis.

        <img class="center" src="https://staff.aist.go.jp/v.zayets/SpinTransport/32/OrbitFulls.gif" alt="">

        <strong>Question:</strong> Is the spin-orbit interaction proportional to the orbital moment?
        <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> No. Even though there are common tendencies
        between the spin-orbit interaction and the orbital moment. For example,
        when the orbital moment is zero, the spin-orbit interaction is zero.
        When the orbital moment changes its sign, the spin-orbit interaction
        changes its sign as well. <br>
        Even though "orbit" is a part of the name of the spin-orbit interaction,
        the relation between orbital moment and $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ is complex
        and not straightforward.<br><br>

        <strong>Question:</strong> How is it possible that an electron, while
        rotating around a nucleus, does not experience the spin-orbit interaction?
        <br>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> It is because for the spherical orbit an electron
        makes an equal number of rotations in two opposite directions. Since for
        opposite rotation directions, the directions of the effective magnetic
        field of the spin-orbit interaction are opposite, an electron does not
        experience any spin-orbit interaction.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Types of Spin-Orbit interaction</h3>

        It is convenient to divide effects related to the spin-orbit interaction
        into 3 classes depending on the source of the electrical field and the
        source of breaking of the time-reversal symmetry.

        <ul>
          <li>Type 1: Weak spin-orbit interaction</li>
          <li>Type 2: Strong spin-orbit interaction</li>
          <li>Type 3: Moderate spin-orbit interaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Type 1: Weak spin-orbit interaction</h4>

        Only the conduction electrons experience this type of spin-orbit effect.
        The electrical field at an interface or electrical field of a Schottky
        barrier is the sources of the electrical field for this type. An
        electrical current flowing along with the interface and perpendicularly
        to the interface electrical field breaks the time-reversal symmetry.
        <br><br>

        This type of effect includes:

        <ul>
          <li>spin Hall effect</li>
          <li>anomalous spin Hall effect</li>
          <li>anomalous magneto-resistance</li>
          <li>rashba effect</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Type 2: Strong spin-orbit interaction</h4>

        Only localized electrons (e.g. d- or f- electrons) experience this type
        of spin-orbit effect. The centrosymmetric electrical field of the atomic
        nucleus is the source of this type of spin-orbit effect. An external
        magnetic field is a source of breaking the time-reversal symmetry.
        <br><br>

        This type of effect includes:

        <ul>
          <li>perpendicular magnetic anisotropy</li>
          <li>g-factor</li>
          <li>magneto-elastic effect</li>
          <li>voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy</li>
          <li>interface sensing</li>
          <li>magnetic anisotropy</li>
        </ul>

        In absence of external magnetic field, a localized electron does
        not experience any $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$. However, when an external
        magnetic field $\mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ is applied, it induces strong
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ parallel to $\mathbf{H}_\text{ext}$ and the
        electron experiences a stronger total magnetic field
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{total} = \mathbf{H}_\text{ext} + \mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$.
        <br><br>

        The orbital moment of the localized electrons is zero. Any 3D orbital
        can be represented as the sum of two 2D orbitals of clockwise and
        anti-clockwise electron rotation. Clockwise and anti-clockwise orbitals
        are identical. As a result, the electron experience the same but opposite
        $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ for the clockwise and anti-clockwise orbitals.
        <br><br>

        When an external magnetic field is applied, the time-reversal symmetry
        is broken. Since electron rotations in the clockwise and anti-clockwise
        orbitals are opposite, the Lorentz force is the opposite. As a result,
        the clockwise and anti-clockwise orbitals are deformed differently in
        an external magnetic field, $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$ becomes different
        for clockwise and anti-clockwise orbitals and in total the electron
        experiences a non-zero $\mathbf{H}_\text{SO}$.

        <img class="center" src="https://staff.aist.go.jp/v.zayets/SpinTransport/32/TimeInverseYesS.gif" alt="">

        <h4>Type 3: Moderate spin-orbit interaction</h4>

        Only conduction electrons experience this type of effect. The centrosymmetric
        electrical field of the atomic nucleus is the source of the electrical
        field. Electrical current breaks the time-reversal symmetry. <br><br>

        This type of effect includes:

        <ul>
          <li>spin Hall effect</li>
          <li>spin pumping</li>
          <li>inverse spin Hall effect</li>
          <li>spin damping</li>
          <li>spin-orbit torque</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Spin-Orbit interaction from the Dirac equations</h3>

        Einstein's relativistic equation for the energy is,
        $$E^2 = p^2c^2 - m_o^2c^4$$
        which should describe the electric field as well.

        The quantum-mechanical operator for the energy and the momentum are,
        $$\bar{p} \rightarrow - i \hbar \nabla \text{ ;} \\ \bar{E} = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$$

        Now, the relation between relativistic and quantum mechanics can found that,

        $$\left( \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \frac{m_o^2 c^2}{\hbar^2}\right) \Psi(r,t) = 0 $$

        This is called the Klein-Gordon equation. <br><br>

        The wave equation should be 1st order differential equation with respect
        to time and space. Dirac found that the Klein-Gordon equation can be
        represented as a product of a 1st order differential equation and its
        conjugate. Therefore, the Dirac equations describes the electrical field.

        $$\left( A \partial_x + B \partial_y + C \partial_z + \frac{i}{c} D \partial_t - \frac{m_o c}{\hbar}\right) \Psi = 0 $$

        Setting,

        $$D = \gamma^0 \text{ ;} \qquad A = i \gamma^1 \text{ ;} \\ B = i \gamma^2 \text{ ;} \qquad C = i \gamma^3$$

        $$\partial_0 = \frac{1}{c} \partial_t \text{ ;} \qquad \partial_1 = \partial_x \text{ ;} \\ \partial_2 = \partial_y \text{ ;} \qquad \partial_3 = \partial_z $$

        where, $\gamma$ denotes the $(2 \times 2)$ sub-matrices taken from the Pauli matrices.

        The Dirac equation,

        $$i \hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \Psi - m_o c \Psi = 0$$
        where, $\mu = 0,1,2,3$ <br><br>

        The Dirac equation, which includes the gauge potential, is

        $$ \gamma^\mu (i \hbar \partial_\mu - e A_\mu) \Psi - m_o c \Psi = 0$$
