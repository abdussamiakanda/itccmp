        <span class="bar"></span>
        In December 2023, we, a small group of two people, who are graduate
        students from Bangladesh studying in the USA, came together with a
        shared dream. That dream was the Institution for Theoretical and
        Computational Physics Research (ITCPR), born out of our collective
        passion for physics and a desire to make research opportunities more
        accessible.

        <span class="bar"></span>
        At ITCPR, our vision is to be a pioneering force in the realm of
        theoretical and computational physics, breaking new ground in research
        and innovation. We aspire to create a global community where passion for
        physics knows no boundaries, and opportunities for groundbreaking
        research are accessible to everyone, regardless of their geographical or
        socioeconomic background. Our goal is to equip aspiring physicists from
        underrepresented regions with the tools, knowledge, and platform they
        need to excel and contribute to the scientific world. Through
        collaboration, mentorship, and a commitment to excellence, we aim to not
        only advance the field of physics but also inspire a new generation of
        scientists who will continue to push the frontiers of what is possible.
