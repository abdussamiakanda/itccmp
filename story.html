        <div class="title">Our Story</div>
        <span class="bar"></span>
        In December 2023, atop the breathtaking Rocky Mountains, two graduate
        students from Bangladesh studying in the USA found themselves reflecting
        on a long-standing dream. Surrounded by the serene beauty of nature, we
        solidified our shared visionâ€”the Institute for Theoretical and
        Computational Physics Research (ITCPR). This moment was the culmination
        of years of aspiration and dedication, dating back to at least 2018
        when the seed of this idea first took root in our minds.
        <br /><br />
        Our passion for physics and our desire to make research opportunities
        more accessible have been guiding lights throughout our academic
        journeys. Over the years, we dreamed of a platform where budding
        physicists could collaborate, learn, and contribute to pushing the
        boundaries of knowledge. That day in the Rockies, we decided it was
        time to turn this dream into a reality. ITCPR was born not just as
        an institute but as a testament to the power of dreams,
        collaboration, and the enduring spirit of curiosity.
