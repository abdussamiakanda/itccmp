          <span>Welcome to the Institution for Theoretical and Computational Physics Research</span> <br />
          <h1>Our Story</h1> <br/>

          In December 2023, we, a small group of graduate students from Bangladesh studying in
          the USA, came together with a shared dream. That dream was the Institution for
          Theoretical and Computational Physics Research (ITCPR), born out of our collective
          passion for physics and a desire to make research opportunities more accessible.

          <h1>Our Vision</h1> <br/>
          At ITCPR, our vision is to be a pioneering force in the realm of theoretical and
          computational physics, breaking new ground in research and innovation. We aspire
          to create a global community where passion for physics knows no boundaries, and
          opportunities for groundbreaking research are accessible to everyone, regardless
          of their geographical or socioeconomic background. Our goal is to equip aspiring
          physicists from underrepresented regions with the tools, knowledge, and platform
          they need to excel and contribute to the scientific world. Through collaboration,
          mentorship, and a commitment to excellence, we aim to not only advance the field
          of physics but also inspire a new generation of scientists who will continue to
          push the frontiers of what is possible.
