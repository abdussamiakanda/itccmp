            <code>learning</code>, <code>mumax3</code>,
            <code>python-codes</code>, and <code>yournameID</code>. You'll see a
            file named <code>jupyter.bat</code>, which opens Jupyter Notebook.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>learning</code> folder contains tasks for your training
            period that are mendatory for you to complete to start working in
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>mumax3</code> folder contains sample mumax3 codes, which
            will be useful for learning our simulation codes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>python-codes</code> folder contains sample python codes,
            which will be useful for your research journey in our institution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>yournameID</code> folder will contain your personal files
            for ressearch. You can create subfolders and store your research
            files in this folder. Inside this folder, there's a file named
            <code>z_git_push.bat</code>, which will push your files to Github.
